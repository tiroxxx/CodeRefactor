# CodeRefactor
In this project, I condensed the CSS file significantly. Deleted any redundant code and added semantic tags throught the HTML file. Also moved some of the css code so it would follow a logical structure in relation to their HTML counterpart. Lastly, corrected errors with the links giving them the correct href attribute.
